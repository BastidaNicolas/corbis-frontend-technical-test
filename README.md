# Angular Project Setup Guide

## Cloning the Repository
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   `git clone <repository_link>`
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   `cd <project_folder_name>`
   
## Installation and Running
1. Install project dependencies using npm:
   `npm install`
2. Run the development server:
   `ng serve`
3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4200/` to see your app in action.

## Quick Access (Deployment)
- If you're not interested in setting up the project locally, you can access the deployed version directly:
ðŸš€ [corbis-test.netlify.app](https://corbis-test.netlify.app/)

## Note
- Make sure you have Node.js and Angular CLI installed on your system before following these steps. If not, you can install them from the official websites:
    - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
    - [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.8.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
